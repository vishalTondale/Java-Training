Threads   

Thread : flow/way of execution


execution is Concurrent : time based 

ways of creating threads 
1. implementing Runnable interface
    - creating Thread class object 
    - threadObject.start(objectOfClass)
2. extending Thread class and overriding run method
    start()  internally calls --> run()


- Thread Scheduler shedule which thread to run.
- we cant control thread scheduler we can add priority to thread from 0 to 10 when 10 is the maximum priority.
- methods 
        sleep(ms);



Mutation : changing something

Thread safe : One Thread can work with one source/method




















Lambda expression : works whenever we have functional interface
