Object Oriented Programming in Java

class  : Template to create an object  (blueprint)

object : An instance of an class 



Pillars of object orientation 

1. Inheritance  
    - inheriting properties and behaviour from parent class or base class using "extends" Keyword.
    - Types of inheritance 
        - Single level inheritance
            - an single child class inheriting properties and behaviour from its parent class
            - single child class single parent class
        - Multi-level inheritance
            - an chain of single level inheritance.
            - chain of single child class single parent class
            -   .... -> child - > parent -> grand parent
        - Hybrid inheritance  
            - combination of two or more types of inheritance 
        - Hieranchial inheritance 
            - one parent class multiple child class
        - Multiple inheritance (possible only using interfaces)
            - one child class inheriting properties and behaviour from multiple parent classes.
            - one child class Multiple parent class
        - Cyclic inheritance (not possible in java) 
            - child class inherits parent class and parent class inherits from child class

2. Encapsulation
     -Encapsulation refers to bundeling the data and methods together. and giving the controlled access by using access modifiers
     - private , public, protected 


3. Abstraction :
    - showing what it does and hiding how it does is abstraction.
    - providing functionality and hiding implementation by using abstract classes and interfaces.



4. Polymorphism 
    - Allows objects to behave differently with respect to object type.
    - same name different work
    - Types : 
         -Compile time 
            - Method overloading
                - method has same name but differ in number of parameters, types and order of parameters.
         - Run time  
            - Method Overriding 
                -  inhering the method from the parent class and changing its behaviour.




Interface 
    - Created by using interface keyword and used to set up rules or standards or templates.
    - we can achive multiple inheritance using interface because interface dont have super class to build an diamond shape problem.
    - It dont have concreate methods to form an ambiguity problem.
